Yet another project that might go nowhere
-----

The intent is to design a state machine for yoyo tricks and combos.
I don't know every trick but it'll be useful to create some sort of database
of tricks that blend together so people can quickly generate speed combos and 
the like. Maybe some ranking system internally to incentivize good tricks from
shitty ones.
